<!-- If the background is white or light: Use the Red (#C71F2B) or Dark Red/Burgundy
(#991B1E) for the icons. These colors will stand out and are strong accent
colors from the logo. If the background is darker or colored: Consider using the
Yellow (#FFD100) or Orange (#F47920) for a brighter, eye-catching effect. For a
sleek, minimal design, Black (#000000) can also work well, especially if you
want the icons to be subtle yet elegant. -->
